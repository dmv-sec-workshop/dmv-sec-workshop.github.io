# Workshop at a Glance

The DMV Security Workshop is launching its inaugural event in the 2023-2024 academic year. This new series aims to unite researchers in computer security and privacy from `Washington DC`, `Maryland`, and `Virginia`.

This workshop will be an `in-person event` at Rice Hall in the beautiful campus of the University of Virginia, taking place on `March 4th, 2024` from `10:30am` to `5:30pm`. The session will cover <b>speed advising</b>, <b>faculty/students lightning talks</b> and <b>break-out discussion sessions</b>. Unlike traditional conferences, DMV Security Workshop emphasizes future collaborations over past work presentations, offering a unique platform for seeding new partnerships and ideas.

The event is open to all researchers in the field from the DMV area. To encourage broad participation, registration for the workshop is free. We will provide coffee and light snacks during breaks, but participants are on their own for covering the costs of all other food, transportation, accommodations (if applicable), and other logistics.
